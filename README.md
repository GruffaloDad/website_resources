# website_resources
General repository for all things for my new website
By way of description, I've decided to take the plunge and create a website using silex.me.
This means I shall be using this repository for the resources I need to apply in the web-app.
Since all of this is going to be made public sooner or later, there's no reason to hide any of it away.
However, I guess that my content here will be of no interest to anyone else other than myself.
If I'm wrong, let me know!
